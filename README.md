# to-do
A simple to-do page(with a malfunctioning alarm clock function).

## My To-do List 
Do pardon the prompt on the page, if there's no humor, I don't woork as well as I should. 
I've built a few functiions into this and while i tried to use class constructors to get through this, it just wasn't meant to be. This works fine either way.

### The Test Process
- Just put in your task name and a time for it(optional). The alarm should ring, but it won't, for some inexplicable reason. I'm just gonna add an alert at the time instead.
- After your task is created, you can tap on it(touchscreen phones), or hover over it(pc cursor) for a floating menu with buttons for edit, delete and complete.
- clicking the check(complete) button creates an undo button.
- Deleting a task crosses it off the list for 0.5 secs and then removes from the task object.
